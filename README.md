# Awesome train Europe 🚋 🇪🇺

Resources for train travel through Europe.
Because it is fast, fun and slow.

## Planning

- [Seat61](https://www.seat61.com/): Although it looks somewhat outdated, it is a gold mine of information on train travel in Europe and the world, sorted by countries and cities. It also provides alternative roads and touristic information.
- [Omio](https://www.omio.com/): a platform that allows you to compare and book trains, buses, and flights across Europe. It's a handy tool for planning multi-modal journeys.
- [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps): Use Google Maps to check train routes, schedules, and travel times. It's a great tool for visualizing your journey and planning connections.
- [The European Rail Timetable](https://www.europeanrailtimetable.eu/): a valuable resource for planning train journeys. It provides detailed schedules for trains across Europe.
- [RailCC](https://rail.cc/): a community-driven website that offers information on train routes, stations, and travel tips. It also has a forum where travelers share their experiences.
